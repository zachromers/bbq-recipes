    // PORK
    'Classic Smoked Pulled Pork': `<p>There's something almost magical about the moment you pull apart a perfectly smoked pork shoulder. The meat just falls away in tender strands, releasing that incredible smoky aroma that's been building for the past eight hours. This is the dish that turned me into a BBQ enthusiast, and it remains my go-to recipe for feeding a crowd.</p><p>I love serving this pulled pork at summer cookouts, football watch parties, and family reunions. It's the kind of dish that brings people together around the table, everyone building their own perfect sandwich. The beauty of pulled pork is its versatility - it works just as well for a casual backyard gathering as it does for a more formal dinner party.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>For sides, I always recommend a creamy coleslaw to cut through the richness of the meat. The cool, crisp texture provides the perfect contrast. I also love pairing this with classic baked beans, mac and cheese, and some tangy pickles on the side. Cornbread is non-negotiable in my house - there's nothing better for soaking up all those delicious juices.</p><p>As for variations, you can take this recipe in so many directions. Try a Carolina-style vinegar sauce for a tangier finish, or go Memphis-style with a dry rub and no sauce at all. I've also had great success adding a splash of apple cider to the pulled meat for extra moisture and a subtle sweetness. For a fun twist, use the pulled pork in tacos with a pineapple salsa, or pile it high on nachos with jalapeños and queso.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The key to great pulled pork is patience. Don't rush the cook - low and slow is the mantra here. I've found that wrapping the shoulder in butcher paper once it hits the stall helps push through without sacrificing that beautiful bark. And whatever you do, don't skip the rest period. That hour of resting allows the juices to redistribute, making every bite incredibly moist and flavorful.</p>`,

    'Competition-Style Baby Back Ribs': `<p>If there's one dish that defines backyard BBQ for me, it's a perfectly smoked rack of baby back ribs. These competition-style ribs have that ideal balance of smoke, sweetness, and spice that keeps people coming back for seconds and thirds. I've spent years perfecting this recipe, and it never fails to impress.</p><p>These ribs are perfect for summer holidays - Fourth of July, Memorial Day, Labor Day - basically any excuse to fire up the smoker. They're also fantastic for birthday parties and casual weekend cookouts. There's something deeply satisfying about watching people pick up a rib and just go to town on it.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>I enjoy serving these ribs with traditional BBQ sides. Creamy potato salad is a must, along with some sweet corn on the cob brushed with herb butter. Baked beans cooked low and slow complement the smoky flavor beautifully. For something lighter, a simple cucumber salad with vinegar dressing helps balance the richness. And of course, plenty of napkins - these ribs are gloriously messy.</p><p>For variations, you can experiment with different wood chips to change the smoke profile. Cherry wood gives a slightly sweeter, fruitier smoke that I really enjoy with pork. You can also try different sauce styles - a spicy chipotle BBQ sauce adds great heat, while a honey bourbon glaze creates an incredible sticky-sweet finish.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The 3-2-1 method is a great starting point, but I've found that baby backs often do better with a 2-2-1 approach since they're more tender than spare ribs. The real test is the bend - pick up the rack with tongs and if it bends and the meat starts to crack on the surface, you're in the zone.</p>`,

    'Smoked Pork Belly Burnt Ends': `<p>Pork belly burnt ends might just be the most addictive thing I've ever made on my smoker. These little cubes of caramelized, smoky, melt-in-your-mouth goodness are like meat candy. Once you try them, you'll understand why they disappear from the serving platter in minutes flat.</p><p>I typically make these for special occasions when I really want to wow my guests. They're incredible as an appetizer for a dinner party, served with toothpicks so people can grab them easily. They also work great as the star of a BBQ spread, or even as a decadent topping for loaded fries or nachos.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>For accompaniments, I like to serve these with something that cuts through all that rich, fatty goodness. A tangy vinegar-based slaw works wonderfully, as does a simple green salad with a sharp lemon vinaigrette. Pickled vegetables provide a great acidic counterpoint. If you're going all-out, serve them over creamy grits or fluffy rice to catch all those incredible juices.</p><p>While the classic preparation uses a sweet BBQ sauce glaze, there's plenty of room for creativity here. Try an Asian-inspired version with hoisin, soy sauce, and a touch of five-spice. A spicy honey glaze with cayenne and garlic is absolutely phenomenal. I've even done a maple bourbon variation that's perfect for fall gatherings.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The secret to perfect burnt ends is getting that caramelization just right. You want the exterior to be slightly crispy and deeply glazed while the interior stays buttery soft. Don't be afraid to crank up the heat at the end or finish them under a broiler to get that perfect char on the edges.</p>`,

    'Honey Garlic Smoked Pork Chops': `<p>When I want a weeknight dinner that feels special but doesn't require hours of smoking, these honey garlic pork chops are my answer. The sweet and savory glaze creates a beautiful caramelized exterior while the smoke adds that depth of flavor that makes everything better. This is comfort food at its finest.</p><p>These chops are perfect for a nice family dinner any night of the week, but they're also elegant enough for a date night at home. I've served them at small dinner parties and they always get rave reviews. The presentation is beautiful with that glossy honey glaze, and they come together relatively quickly compared to longer BBQ cooks.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>I love serving these with roasted vegetables - asparagus, Brussels sprouts, or green beans all work beautifully. A side of creamy mashed potatoes is essential for soaking up that incredible honey garlic sauce. For a lighter option, a crisp apple and walnut salad provides a nice contrast to the rich pork. Rice pilaf or buttered egg noodles are also excellent choices.</p><p>The honey garlic glaze is delicious as written, but feel free to customize it. Adding a splash of bourbon creates wonderful depth, while a bit of Dijon mustard adds a subtle tang. For some heat, mix in red pepper flakes or a touch of sriracha. You can also try different honey varieties for different flavor profiles.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The key to juicy pork chops is not overcooking them. With modern pork, 145°F internal temperature gives you perfectly safe, juicy meat. Brining beforehand is my secret weapon - it ensures the chops stay moist even if you slightly overshoot the target temperature.</p>`,

    'Smoked Pork Tenderloin': `<p>Pork tenderloin is one of the most underrated cuts for smoking. It's lean, cooks relatively quickly, and absorbs smoke flavor beautifully. With a fresh herb crust, this elegant dish is perfect for impressing guests without spending all day tending the smoker. It's become one of my favorite weeknight BBQ options.</p><p>This recipe shines at dinner parties where you want something a bit more refined than typical BBQ fare. It's also wonderful for Sunday family dinners or holiday meals when you want to offer something different from the usual ham or turkey. The medallion presentation looks restaurant-quality on the plate.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>For sides, I gravitate toward dishes that complement the herb crust. Roasted fingerling potatoes with the same herbs create a cohesive flavor profile. Sautéed spinach or Swiss chard adds color and nutrition. A wild rice blend or risotto elevates the meal further. For something lighter, an arugula salad with shaved Parmesan and lemon dressing is perfect.</p><p>While rosemary and thyme are classic, don't hesitate to experiment with other herb combinations. A Mediterranean twist with oregano, lemon zest, and sun-dried tomato works wonderfully. Try a Southwestern version with cumin, chili powder, and lime. For an Asian-inspired variation, use five-spice, ginger, and sesame.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Because tenderloin is so lean, it can dry out if overcooked. I always pull mine at 145°F and let it rest for at least 10 minutes - carryover cooking will bring it to the perfect temperature. Slicing it into medallions right before serving ensures everyone gets beautifully presented, evenly cooked pieces.</p>`,

    'Carolina Vinegar Pulled Pork': `<p>If you want to taste BBQ history, this Eastern Carolina-style pulled pork is where it's at. The tangy vinegar sauce cuts through the rich, smoky pork in a way that's absolutely addictive. No thick, sweet sauce here - just pure, honest BBQ that lets the meat shine. This is the style I grew up eating, and it holds a special place in my heart.</p><p>This pulled pork is essential for traditional Southern cookouts and pig pickings. It's the star of any Carolina-style BBQ spread and works perfectly for large gatherings since it feeds a crowd easily. I make this for family reunions, church potlucks, and any time I'm feeling nostalgic.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The traditional way to serve this is on a soft white bun with coleslaw piled right on top of the meat - not on the side, on the sandwich itself. The cool, creamy slaw against the hot, tangy pork is pure magic. Classic sides include hush puppies, collard greens, sweet tea, and banana pudding for dessert.</p><p>The vinegar sauce can be adjusted to your taste. Some folks add more red pepper flakes for extra heat, while others prefer a touch more brown sugar to balance the acidity. A splash of your favorite hot sauce is a common addition. Some regions add a bit of tomato for a Piedmont-style variation.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The magic of this dish is in its simplicity. Don't overthink the rub - salt and pepper are really all you need since the vinegar sauce provides plenty of flavor. The long, slow smoke does all the heavy lifting, breaking down the collagen and creating that pullable, tender texture that soaks up the sauce beautifully.</p>`,

    'Smoked Pork Shoulder Steaks': `<p>Pork shoulder steaks are one of those budget-friendly cuts that punch way above their weight class when kissed with smoke. They're more forgiving than chops, with more marbling and connective tissue that keeps them juicy and flavorful. When I want great BBQ without a full-day commitment, these steaks are my go-to choice.</p><p>These are perfect for casual weeknight dinners when you're craving that smoky flavor but don't have 8 hours to spare. They're also great for tailgating since they cook relatively quickly and are easy to portion. I've served them at countless backyard cookouts where they always get devoured.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>I enjoy pairing these steaks with simple, hearty sides. A big baked potato loaded with butter and sour cream is classic. Grilled corn on the cob with chili-lime butter adds nice color to the plate. Baked beans are a natural companion, as is a crisp green salad to lighten things up.</p><p>These steaks take well to different flavor profiles. Try a Cuban mojo marinade with orange and lime juice for something bright and citrusy. A coffee-based rub adds an earthy depth that's surprisingly delicious with pork. Korean BBQ flavors create an incredible fusion dish.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The key with shoulder steaks is cooking them long enough to render the fat and break down the connective tissue. Unlike lean chops that you want to pull at 145°F, these benefit from going higher - around 180°F - where that intramuscular fat becomes silky and the meat gets super tender.</p>`,

    'Maple Bourbon Glazed Ham': `<p>Nothing says holiday celebration quite like a beautiful glazed ham coming out of the smoker. The maple bourbon glaze creates this gorgeous, glossy finish that's sweet, slightly boozy, and absolutely irresistible. Every time I make this for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter, it becomes the centerpiece that everyone gathers around.</p><p>This ham is obviously perfect for holiday dinners, but don't limit yourself to just those occasions. It's wonderful for Easter brunch, graduation parties, or any large family gathering. The leftovers are half the fun - ham sandwiches, ham and eggs, ham fried rice - the possibilities are endless.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Traditional holiday sides pair beautifully with this ham. Scalloped potatoes or a cheesy potato casserole are essential in my family. Green bean casserole, roasted Brussels sprouts, or glazed carrots add color and vegetables to the spread. A sweet potato casserole with pecans echoes the maple sweetness nicely.</p><p>The maple bourbon glaze is perfect as written, but variations abound. Swap the bourbon for rum for a slightly different flavor profile. Add some Dijon mustard for a tangy kick that balances the sweetness. A touch of ground cloves or cinnamon adds warm spice notes that feel especially festive.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Since the ham is already cooked, you're really just warming it through and building that beautiful glaze. The key is patience with the glazing process - multiple thin layers create a better finish than one thick application. Score the fat in a diamond pattern to let the glaze penetrate and create those gorgeous caramelized edges.</p>`,

    'Smoked Pork Spare Ribs': `<p>Spare ribs are the bigger, meatier cousin of baby backs, and in many ways, I prefer them. There's more fat, more connective tissue, and when cooked properly, they're incredibly rich and satisfying. These St. Louis-style ribs are trimmed up nice and neat, making for a beautiful presentation and even cooking.</p><p>I make these for serious BBQ gatherings where people know their ribs. They're perfect for summer cookouts, watching the big game, or any occasion where you want to serve up authentic BBQ. The generous size means each rib is a substantial serving, which guests always appreciate.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Spare ribs demand classic BBQ sides. Coleslaw is absolutely essential - I prefer a vinegar-based slaw with these since it cuts through the richness. Baked beans, preferably homemade with plenty of bacon, are non-negotiable. Corn on the cob, potato salad, and cornbread round out the spread.</p><p>For variations, try different regional styles. Kansas City-style uses a sweet, tomato-based sauce applied at the end. Texas-style keeps it simple with just salt and pepper, letting the smoke and meat flavors dominate. Memphis-style goes dry with a heavy spice rub and no sauce at all.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The trimmings you remove when making St. Louis cut aren't waste - they're rib tips! Season and smoke those right alongside the main ribs. They're fattier and cook faster, making perfect snacks for the pitmaster while waiting for the main event.</p>`,

    'Smoked Sausage Links': `<p>Making your own sausage from scratch and then smoking it is one of those projects that seems intimidating but is incredibly rewarding. The snap of that casing when you bite through, followed by the juicy, perfectly seasoned meat inside - it's a revelation compared to store-bought. Once you make your own, you'll be hooked.</p><p>These sausages are versatile - serve them at a weekend breakfast spread, slice them for pasta or jambalaya, or grill them up for a casual dinner. They're perfect for Oktoberfest celebrations with all the traditional accompaniments. I often make a big batch and freeze them for quick weeknight meals.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>For breakfast, serve these alongside scrambled eggs, hash browns, and toast. At dinner, I love them with sauerkraut and whole grain mustard, plus some roasted potatoes or warm German potato salad. Peppers and onions sautéed together make a perfect topping. Beer and sausage is a timeless pairing.</p><p>The basic recipe here is a great foundation, but sausage-making invites creativity. Add fennel seeds and red pepper flakes for an Italian-style sausage. Include garlic, paprika, and marjoram for a Polish kielbasa flavor. Fresh herbs create a lighter, breakfast-style sausage.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The key to good sausage is keeping everything cold - the meat, the fat, the grinder parts. Warm fat smears instead of staying in distinct pieces, which affects texture. Also, don't overstuff the casings - leave room for expansion during cooking to avoid blowouts.</p>`,

    'Cuban Mojo Pork': `<p>This Cuban mojo pork brings the flavors of Havana to your backyard smoker. The citrus and garlic marinade creates incredibly flavorful meat that's bright and zesty, a nice departure from typical BBQ flavor profiles. It's become one of my favorite ways to prepare pork shoulder when I want something a little different.</p><p>This dish is perfect for Cuban-themed dinner parties or summer gatherings where you want to offer something beyond standard BBQ. It's fantastic for Noche Buena celebrations or any time you're craving those Caribbean flavors. The meat also makes incredible sandwiches the next day.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>For an authentic Cuban experience, serve this with black beans and white rice - it's a mandatory combination. Fried sweet plantains add sweetness that complements the tangy pork. A simple cucumber and tomato salad dressed with lime helps lighten the meal. For Cuban sandwiches with the leftovers, you'll need Swiss cheese, ham, pickles, and mustard.</p><p>The mojo can be adjusted to your preferences. More sour orange juice intensifies the citrus punch. Additional cumin adds earthiness, while oregano increases the herbal notes. Some versions include a bit of citrus zest for extra brightness. For more heat, add a scotch bonnet to the marinade.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Don't skip the marinating time - overnight is ideal. The acid in the citrus juice starts to tenderize the meat while the garlic and spices penetrate deeply. Basting with the reserved marinade during cooking builds layer upon layer of flavor on the exterior.</p>`,

    'Smoked Pork Loin Roast': `<p>When I want an elegant smoked pork dish that serves a crowd without the long cook time of a shoulder, this apple-glazed loin is my answer. The lean meat stays juicy thanks to the sweet glaze, and the smoke adds complexity that elevates this simple cut to something special. It slices beautifully for serving.</p><p>This roast is perfect for holiday dinners when you want something lighter than ham but still festive. It works wonderfully for Sunday family dinners, dinner parties, or any occasion where you want to impress without spending all day at the smoker. The apple glaze makes it feel autumnal and comforting.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>I serve this with sides that complement the apple theme. Roasted root vegetables - carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes - are perfect alongside. A wild rice pilaf or creamy polenta provides a good base. Sautéed green beans with almonds add color and crunch. For a real treat, serve with homemade applesauce.</p><p>The apple jelly glaze is delicious, but you can vary it many ways. Apricot preserves create a similar sweet coating with a different fruit note. A fig and balsamic glaze is wonderfully sophisticated. For fall, try a pumpkin butter glaze with warming spices.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Pork loin is lean, so monitoring the internal temperature is crucial. Pull it at 145°F and let it rest - the carryover cooking will bring it to perfect doneness. Tenting with foil during the rest keeps it warm while the juices redistribute. Slicing against the grain ensures every piece is tender.</p>`,

    'Asian BBQ Pork Belly': `<p>When East meets West on the smoker, magic happens. This Chinese-inspired pork belly combines the incredible texture of smoked belly with the sweet-savory depth of hoisin glaze. The crispy skin and meltingly tender meat create the ultimate contrast. It's become one of my most requested recipes for good reason.</p><p>This dish is perfect for Asian-themed dinner parties or fusion BBQ gatherings. It makes an incredible appetizer served in small bites, or a main course for a more intimate dinner. Chinese New Year, birthday celebrations, or any time you want to wow guests - this belly delivers.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Serve this with steamed white rice or fried rice to soak up all those delicious juices. Quick-pickled cucumbers provide a refreshing contrast to the rich meat. Stir-fried bok choy adds greens to the plate. For a full experience, serve with steamed bao buns and let guests make their own pork belly sandwiches.</p><p>The hoisin glaze can be customized many ways. Add more five-spice for deeper complexity. Gochujang instead of or alongside hoisin adds a wonderful spicy kick. A teriyaki variation with sake and mirin is equally delicious. For extra umami, a touch of oyster sauce takes it over the top.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The key to crispy skin is getting it completely dry before smoking, then finishing under a hot broiler or with a torch. Score the skin in a crosshatch pattern to help fat render and allow the glaze to penetrate. The contrast of shatteringly crisp skin and silky fat beneath is what makes this special.</p>`,

    'Memphis Dry Rub Ribs': `<p>In Memphis, they understand that sometimes the best sauce is no sauce at all. These dry rub ribs let the spice blend and smoke do all the talking, creating ribs with incredible depth of flavor in every bite. The bark that forms during the long smoke is pure magic - savory, slightly sweet, and packed with complexity.</p><p>These ribs are perfect for BBQ purists who appreciate the craft of smoking meat. They're ideal for competitions where you want judges to taste your skills, not a store-bought sauce. I also love serving them at gatherings where I know there are sauce-lovers and dry-rub fans - everyone can enjoy them their way.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Classic Memphis sides are the way to go here. Tangy coleslaw helps cut through the richness without adding competing sweetness. Baked beans complement without overwhelming. White bread is traditional for soaking up any juices on your plate. Sweet tea to drink, and you've got yourself an authentic Memphis spread.</p><p>The rub is where you can really make this recipe your own. More paprika creates a deeper color and sweeter flavor. Increase the cayenne if you like heat. Some pitmasters add celery salt for an extra savory note. A touch of coffee grounds adds incredible depth and helps form an amazing bark.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The beauty of dry ribs is the bark - that flavorful crust that forms during the long smoke. Don't wrap these; you want the surface exposed to smoke the entire time. If they look like they're getting too dark, move them to a cooler part of the smoker rather than wrapping. Patience rewards you with ribs that need no adornment.</p>`,

    'Smoked Porchetta': `<p>Italian porchetta is already one of the world's great pork preparations - adding smoke takes it to another dimension. The fennel and herb filling perfumes every slice, while the crackling skin provides irresistible crunch. This is the kind of showstopper that makes your reputation as a host.</p><p>Porchetta is perfect for Italian-themed dinner parties, holiday gatherings, or any special occasion. It's traditionally served at festivals and celebrations in Italy, so it fits right in at your own festive events. Sunday dinner with extended family is another perfect occasion - it feeds a crowd and impresses everyone.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Serve sliced porchetta on crusty Italian bread for incredible sandwiches, or plated with roasted potatoes and bitter greens like broccoli rabe. A simple arugula salad with lemon and Parmesan cuts through the richness beautifully. White beans braised with sage make a hearty accompaniment.</p><p>While fennel is traditional, you can experiment with other Mediterranean flavors. Orange zest and thyme create a Provençal twist. Lemon, oregano, and sun-dried tomatoes give it Greek flair. Keep the structure - seasoned pork belly rolled around a filling - but play with the flavor profile.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Achieving crispy skin is crucial. Score it deeply, rub with salt, and let it dry uncovered in the fridge overnight. Start the cook at a moderate temperature to render the fat, then crank up the heat at the end to blister that skin to crispy perfection.</p>`,

    'Smoked Pork Cheeks': `<p>Pork cheeks are one of those underrated cuts that rewards the adventurous cook. They're incredibly rich with connective tissue that melts into silk during a long braise. Smoking first adds another layer of flavor that makes this humble cut absolutely extraordinary. It's comfort food elevated.</p><p>This is the kind of dish I make for intimate dinner parties with food-loving friends who appreciate discovering lesser-known cuts. It's also perfect for cold weather Sunday dinners when you want something warm and soul-satisfying. The braising liquid becomes a luscious sauce that begs for crusty bread.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Creamy mashed potatoes are essential here - you need something to soak up all that incredible braising liquid. Buttered egg noodles work beautifully too. A side of simply prepared greens adds freshness to the plate. Crusty bread for mopping up every last drop of sauce is absolutely mandatory.</p><p>The braising liquid can be varied in many directions. Red wine and beef stock create a more traditional braise. Try adding Asian aromatics - ginger, star anise, soy sauce - for a completely different result. Mexican flavors work wonderfully too - chiles and cumin make amazing taco filling.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Low and slow is the mantra here. Don't rush the braise - the collagen needs time to break down into gelatin, which is what makes the meat so succulent and the sauce so unctuous. When a fork slides in with no resistance, you're there. The wait is absolutely worth it.</p>`,

    'Cajun Smoked Pork Butt': `<p>This Cajun-spiced pork butt brings the bold flavors of Louisiana to your smoker. The blend of paprika, cayenne, garlic, and herbs creates a flavor profile that's warm, slightly spicy, and deeply savory. It's like a trip to New Orleans without leaving your backyard. This has become my go-to for Mardi Gras celebrations.</p><p>This pork is perfect for Mardi Gras parties, of course, but also works great for any gathering where you want bold, exciting flavors. Tailgates, block parties, and casual summer cookouts are all ideal. The pulled meat is versatile enough to be served many different ways throughout the event.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>For sides, I go full Louisiana. Dirty rice is essential - the Cajun holy trinity ties everything together. Creamy coleslaw provides cool contrast to the spice. Red beans and rice make it a feast. Cornbread with honey butter rounds out the spread. And don't forget the hot sauce on the table.</p><p>Adjust the heat level to your crowd's preferences. More cayenne for spice lovers, or dial back for a milder crowd while keeping all those aromatic flavors. Adding smoked paprika gives an extra layer of smokiness. Some folks like to add a touch of brown sugar to balance the heat.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>This pork makes incredible po'boys - pile it on crusty French bread with spicy mayo, pickles, and hot sauce. It's also fantastic in jambalaya or gumbo when you want to add a smoky element. The versatility of the Cajun flavor profile means leftovers are just as exciting as the first serving.</p>`,

    'Smoked Country-Style Ribs': `<p>Country-style ribs are cut from the shoulder end of the loin, which means they're meatier and more forgiving than true ribs. They take smoke beautifully and stay juicy thanks to their higher fat content. The honey glaze creates a beautiful caramelized exterior that's irresistible. These are perfect for rib lovers who want more meat.</p><p>These are ideal for family dinners when you want something special but don't want to commit to a full rack of ribs. They're portion-friendly, so everyone gets their own piece without any squabbling. Weeknight BBQ, casual weekend cookouts, or a simple dinner party - these ribs fit the bill perfectly.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>I serve these with classic comfort food sides. Mashed potatoes are perfect for that sweet, sticky glaze. Green beans cooked with bacon provide color and complement the pork. Corn on the cob is another great choice. For something lighter, a crisp cucumber salad helps balance the richness.</p><p>The honey BBQ glaze is delicious, but there's room to play. A spicy honey version with cayenne and hot sauce adds welcome heat. Apple cider and brown sugar create a more autumn-appropriate variation. Bourbon adds sophistication to any BBQ glaze.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Since these are thicker than regular ribs, they need more time to become tender. Don't rush it - you're looking for about 195°F internal and a fork that slides in easily. The higher fat content means they stay moist even during the longer cook.</p>`,

    'Smoked Pork Crown Roast': `<p>A crown roast is pure showmanship - there's nothing quite like presenting this impressive ring of pork at a holiday table. The rib bones curve elegantly around a center that you can fill with your favorite stuffing. It's the kind of dish that creates memories and becomes a tradition.</p><p>This roast is meant for special occasions - Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, or milestone celebrations. It's a centerpiece that commands attention and makes your guests feel honored. The wow factor when you bring this to the table is absolutely unmatched.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>For sides, match the elegance of the roast. A wild rice and apple stuffing fills the center beautifully. Roasted Brussels sprouts with balsamic glaze, glazed carrots, or a gratin of your choice all work wonderfully. Creamy mashed potatoes complement perfectly. A simple green salad adds freshness.</p><p>The stuffing in the center is your chance to customize. Traditional bread stuffing with sage is always welcome. Try a cornbread stuffing with pecans for Southern flair. A wild mushroom and herb stuffing feels fancy. Apple and cranberry make it festive for holidays.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Ask your butcher to prepare the crown roast for you - they'll french the bones and tie it properly. Cover the exposed bone tips with foil to prevent burning. The biggest challenge is even cooking, so use a thermometer in multiple spots. Resting is crucial.</p>`,

    'Smoked Stuffed Pork Loin': `<p>Stuffed pork loin is all about that beautiful spiral of meat, cheese, and vegetables when you slice into it. Each piece is a complete flavor package, and the presentation is absolutely stunning. The smoke adds depth that takes this elegant roast to another level. It's easier to make than it looks.</p><p>This dish is perfect for dinner parties where you want to serve something special. Sunday dinners, small holiday gatherings, and date nights at home are all ideal occasions. The portion sizes work perfectly for smaller groups, and the presentation makes everyone feel special.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Italian sides complement the Mediterranean filling beautifully. A simple tomato and fresh mozzarella salad echoes the flavors inside. Risotto or creamy polenta provides an elegant base. Roasted asparagus or broccolini adds green to the plate.</p><p>While spinach and cheese are classic, the filling possibilities are endless. Try mushrooms and Gruyère for an earthy variation. Roasted red peppers and goat cheese create a beautiful color contrast. Apple, brie, and caramelized onion make a sophisticated autumn version.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The key to a neat spiral is butterflying the loin properly - make horizontal cuts without cutting all the way through, opening it like a book. Don't overfill, or it will burst during cooking. Rolling tightly and tying securely ensures even cooking and beautiful presentation.</p>`,

    // BEEF
    'Texas-Style Smoked Brisket': `<p>Brisket is the undisputed king of BBQ, and this Texas-style preparation is as authentic as it gets. Simple salt and pepper rub, post oak smoke, and time - that's all you need to create something extraordinary. When that bark cracks and the fat renders into buttery goodness, you'll understand why pitmasters dedicate their lives to perfecting this craft.</p><p>Brisket is perfect for large gatherings - holidays, graduations, family reunions, or anytime you need to feed a crowd and want to blow them away. It takes commitment, but the payoff is legendary. I save this for special occasions when I can dedicate a full day to the cook.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Keep sides simple and let the brisket shine. White bread, pickles, and sliced onions are traditional Texas accompaniments. I add coleslaw, pinto beans, and potato salad to round out the spread. Mac and cheese is always welcome. The meat should be the star - sides are supporting actors.</p><p>The beauty of Texas-style is its simplicity, but you can still adjust. Some folks add garlic powder to the basic salt and pepper rub. Different woods give different smoke profiles - oak is traditional, but hickory has its fans. You can wrap in butcher paper or foil during the stall.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>Patience is everything with brisket. The stall around 160°F can last hours - don't panic. Probe tender is the real test, not temperature - when your thermometer slides into the flat like butter, you're there. Rest it properly - two hours minimum in a cooler.</p>`,

    'Smoked Beef Short Ribs': `<p>Beef short ribs are brisket's rich, beefy cousin - and honestly, they're more forgiving to cook. These plate-style ribs have incredible marbling that renders during the long smoke, creating meat that's impossibly tender and flavorful. Each rib is like a personal serving of BBQ perfection.</p><p>I make these for serious BBQ lovers who want something special. They're perfect for smaller gatherings where you can give each person their own impressive rib. Holiday dinners, birthday celebrations, or just a Saturday when you want to treat yourself - these ribs make any occasion feel special.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>These rich ribs need sides that can stand up to them. Creamy mashed potatoes or polenta create the perfect base. Roasted vegetables like carrots or Brussels sprouts add color and cut through the richness. A simple green salad with vinaigrette helps cleanse the palate. Keep it elegant - these ribs deserve it.</p><p>While simple salt and pepper let the beef shine, you can experiment. A coffee rub adds earthy depth. Asian flavors create an incredible fusion. Red wine in a finishing glaze adds sophistication. The high fat content means these ribs can handle bold flavors without drying out.</p>${adPlaceholder}<p>The key is taking them all the way to 203°F and probe tender.
